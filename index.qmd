## Why are ferns important?

- Although now they are outnumbered by flowering plants, fern-like plants once **dominated the earth**, playing a major role in global ecology

## Why are ferns important?

- Ferns continue to fill important niches in diverse environments all over the planet

## What exactly are ferns?

- Two groups of plants that have traditionally been studied together: **ferns** and **lycophytes**

- They are all vascular plants that **reproduce via spores** and **lack flowers**

- Collectively, these are called **"pteridophytes"**. Botanists used to think the two groups were closely related, but now DNA has shown that is not so.

## Are ferns ancient plants?

- Ferns and seed plants share a common ancestor

- This makes the fern lineage and the seed plant lineage equally "old"

- Many of fern species alive today evolved as epiphytes on seed plants.

## Ferns have two distinct forms

- "Sporophyte": The larger form that produces spores

- "Gametophyte": Much smaller form that produces gametes (egg and sperm)

## The primary way to study ferns is to observe them in the field

- I use DNA to study fern gametophytes. But even then, basic field observation is a must.

## Field observations in the age of data science

- Increasing ability to aggregate and share data is revolutionizing biology

- Example: iNaturalist

## Open source ethos

- Open source started in software, but can also be applied to science

- The foundation of science is the scientific method and **reproducibility**
  - This applies to analysis as much as experiments
  - You can't reproduce it if you don't have access to the data, code, etc.

- The idea of **open science** is that all data, methods, and results should be publicly and freely available
  - seems simple, but not so easy in practice
  - there is a tendency of scientists to hide their work until everything is completely wrapped up, to prevent being "scooped"
  - also, there are very few incentives to share data and code. The primary currency of research is (still) the publication.

## My open-source research

- I always publish my code and data along with the paper

- I develop open-source software and databases for research

## Ferns x open source

- One of my projects builds on open data, and tries to give back to fuel more research

- FTOL = "Fern Tree of Life". Goal is simple: build a phylogenetic tree including all fern species on the planet (about ~12,000).
  - As a biologist, "Nothing makes sense except in the light of evolution". We need to understand **how things evolved** (in other words, their family tree) to study them.

## How to build a Fern Tree of Life

- Start where the data are. GenBank is a public repository of all published DNA sequences.

- My code crawls GenBank and downloads all fern sequences. It then (mostly) automatically detects and removes misidentifications, then conducts the analysis to produce a phylogenetic tree.

- This had been done before, but always in a "one-off" manner. Previous researchers did not try to keep the tree updated (remember, the primary currency of science is publications. Once the paper is published, few scientists try to update their results).

- FTOL is built (mostly) automatically every three months (if I'm not too busy)

## Growth of FTOL

- The initial publication of FTOL was the largest fern phylogeny to date.

- Number of total fern sequences (and in particular, whole plastomes) has steadily increased since the initial publication.

## Studies supported by FTOL

- Discovery of convergent evolution (same phenomenon evolved in two different groups of organisms) of extra-floral nectaries in ferns and flowering plants

- Some ferns recruit ants for defense by bribing them with sugar, and they did this as they transitioned to living in trees. SO COOL.

## Take-home messages

- Science thrives in the open.
  - More collaborations
  - Less waste
  - Higher quality (fewer mistakes, inadvertent or otherwise)

- We need to incentivize maintenance of databases and software

- Ferns are cool!

## Outline

- What are ferns
  - Why do they matter?
  - Clear up some misconceptions
- What is open science
- Open science x ferns

## Why ferns

- a reduced palette can lead to more creative expressions

## Museomics

- Scientists like to say they study the 'omics' of something (started with "genomics")

- Museomics is the idea that we can study the DNA of museum (or herbarium) specimens

- This is really important because museums are where we store the **type specimen** of a species
  - The specimen that is tied to the initial publication of a species name

## Why are ferns cool?

- Ferns are not as showy as flowers, but are subtly beautiful in their own monochromatic way

- Ferns have a unique life cycle (more on that soon!)
